# Welcome to this website

Hello, my name is John and I am a semi retired surveyor living in the East Midlands, England. Having worked in the construction industry specialising in Architectural Conservation, I have had the opportunity to use various methods of site recording and as a keen wreck diver I have been able use some of these skills to record nautical
archaeological sites both above and below the surface.

I have been a member of the Nautical Archaeological Society (NAS) for a
few years and have worked with them and their partners on some of their sites.
This website records some of the work that has been carried out in that time.
