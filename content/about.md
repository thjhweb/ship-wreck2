Hello, my name is John and I am a semi retired surveyor living in the East Midlands, England. 

Having worked in the construction industry specialising in Architectural Conservation, I have had the opportunity to use various methods of site recording and as a keen wreck diver I have been able use some of these skills to record nautical archaeological sites both above and below the surface.
