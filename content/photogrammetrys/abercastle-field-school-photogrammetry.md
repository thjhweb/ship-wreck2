The photography was carried out by Henry using  a Fuji X-T2 camera in a waterproof housing with a 12mm lens (further details with each image)

The image manipulation was done in Agisoft Metashape which included the following main steps:

1.  loading images; inspecting images, removing unnecessary images;
2.  aligning cameras; (this may be done in chunks)
3.  building dense point cloud;
4.  building mesh (3D polygonal model);
5.  generating texture;
6.  exporting results.
