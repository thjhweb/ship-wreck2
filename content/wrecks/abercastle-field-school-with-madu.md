  In June 2019. Multiple dive clubs joined a field school run by MADU to dive
  the SS Leysian. The field schools formed part of Commemorating the Forgotten
  U-Boat War around the Welsh Coast 1914-18 that was a project co-ordinated by
  the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales
  (RCAHMW), and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). The 2019 field school
  took place over a 10-day period from 7th to 17th June, at Abercastle in
  Pembrokeshire, and included diving on the wreck of the SS Leysian, which lies
  approximately 600m from the slipway in Abercastle Bay in around 8 - 16m of
  water. There were various Surveying exercises carried out both above and below
  the surface. One of the techniques used below the surface was Photogrammetry
  and one of the divers, Henry, photographed four particular areas of the wreck
  and by using 3D software these have been converted into models that can be
  viewed and manipulated on this site.
