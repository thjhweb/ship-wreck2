  In June 2019. Multiple dive clubs joined a field school run by MADU to dive
  the SS Leysian. The field schools formed part of Commemorating the Forgotten
  U-Boat War around the Welsh Coast 1914-18 that was a project co-ordinated by
  the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales
  (RCAHMW), and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). The 2019 field school
  took place over a 10-day period from 7th to 17th June, at Abercastle in
  Pembrokeshire, and included diving on the wreck of the SS Leysian, which lies
  approximately 600m from the slipway in Abercastle Bay in around 8 - 16m of
  water. There were various Surveying exercises carried out both above and below
  the surface. One of the techniques used below the surface was Photogrammetry
  and one of the divers, Henry, photographed four particular areas of the wreck
  and by using 3D software these have been converted into models that can be
  viewed and manipulated on this site.

  The SS Leysian was built in 1906 in Newcastle upon Tyne for a German shipping
  line and was originally named SS Sarek.  She was interned in 1914 at the
  outbreak of war and given to a British shipping line as a prize of war and
  re-named SS Leysian

The WreckÂ  The ship stayed afloat for some months after
hitting the cliff and much of the materials from the ship was salvaged, it is
believed some was brought ashore by boat and some was hoisted up the cliff .

As part of the field school various surveying techniques were used to both record
the wreck and to provide training to those who wished to learn new skills. 

Photogrammetry was used to record the wreck remains below the
waves and a Total Station was used to record the positions of the wreck and the
probable position where the salvaged material were raised onto the cliff top.
