  In June 2019. Multiple dive clubs joined a field school run by MADU to dive
  the SS Leysian. The field schools formed part of Commemorating the Forgotten
  U-Boat War around the Welsh Coast 1914-18 that was a project co-ordinated by
  the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales
  (RCAHMW), and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). The 2019 field school
  took place over a 10-day period from 7th to 17th June, at Abercastle in
  Pembrokeshire, and included diving on the wreck of the SS Leysian, which lies
  approximately 600m from the slipway in Abercastle Bay in around 8 - 16m of
  water. There were various Surveying exercises carried out both above and below
  the surface. One of the techniques used below the surface was Photogrammetry
  and one of the divers, Henry, photographed four particular areas of the wreck
  and by using 3D software these have been converted into models that can be
  viewed and manipulated on this site.

  The SS Leysian was built in 1906 in Newcastle upon Tyne for a German shipping
  line and was originally named SS Sarek.  She was interned in 1914 at the
  outbreak of war and given to a British shipping line as a prize of war and
  re-named SS Leysian, below is a set of the original plans

**The Wreck**

The ship stayed afloat for some months after hitting the cliff and much of the materials from the ship was salvaged, it is believed some material was brought ashore by boat and some was hoisted up the cliff .

As part of the field school various surveying techniques were used to both record
the wreck and to provide training to those who wished to learn new skills.

Photogrammetry was used to record the wreck remains below the
waves and a Total Station was used to record the positions of the wreck and the
probable position where the salvaged materials were raised onto the cliff top.

**Photogrammetry:**

This is a method of obtaining reliable data about physical objects through the process of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images. Above the surface it can be as simple as using a smartphone’s camera although more specialist equipment is needed underwater. Once the photographs, have been taken then software is used to process the data and and create a 3D image.

One of the divers, Henry, photographed four particular areas of the wreck and by using 3D software these have been converted into models that can be viewed and manipulated on this site

**Surveying with a Total Station:**

 A Total Station is a combined Theodolite and an Electronic Distance Measuring device. It is a precision instrument that measures angles in both the horizontal and vertical planes and measures distances

The instrument used at the field school was a Leica TS06 plus 5” R500 – generally considered to be of mid to high accuracy. It has a range of 3500metres and with a reflector target  has an accuracy in the region of 2.5mm

The position of the Leysian wreck surveyed from the cliff top is shown below as well as the concrete bases that may have carried the winches for the salvage operation, the inset shows one of the dive boats on the wreck buoy

The ‘on land’ surveying was carried out by a team of volunteers including G.Adams, Reese, Henry, Hugh and John Hemingway using a Leica TS06 Total Station while a team of Divers from Llantrisant Sub-Aqua Club (Paul Gray, Richy Grice, Ceri Jones, Darren Cox) were in the water.

One diver held the point on the sea bed while another held the reflector on a
floating buoy. Their dive report  showing the method of calculating the reflector position taking into account the current, is shown below.

Below is a view over the wreck site from the surveying position, close to the one of the possible winching positions used in the salvage of the Leysian.

Single Concrete post hole, approx 500 x 500mm concrete with 130 x 130mm hole. There may have been another hole in front of this but it was very indistinct. Coordinate position approx  51.962N    -5.1339 EAST![](/images/ab%20survey%20pic4.jpg)

Below are Concrete bases 1 - Post holes  on the cliff top to the east of the Total Station position. Each approx 500 x 460mm Concrete with 150 x 95mm hole. Coordinate position approx  51.9614N    -5.1329 E![](/images/ab%20survey%202pic5.jpg)
