  Sandwich Flats stretch for about five miles along the Kent coast between
  Pegwell Bay and Deal. Four miles seaward, to the east of Deal, lies the
  Goodwin Sands and The Downs (an area of sheltered sea) Since 2018 the Nautical
  Archaeological Society (NAS) along with MSDS Marine and CitiZan have been
  surveying the foreshore of Sandwich, Kent to record the many wrecks and other
  artefacts that are covered and uncovered with each tide. The surveys have been
  accurately positioned using Leica GPS Real Time Kinematic (RTK) equipment
  augmented with information from a fixed station, and the surveying of local
  areas was done using a Leica TS6 Total Station
