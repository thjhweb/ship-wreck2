  Sandwich Flats stretch for about five miles along the Kent coast between
  Pegwell Bay and Deal. Four miles seaward, to the east of Deal, lies the
  Goodwin Sands and The Downs (an area of sheltered sea) Since 2018 the Nautical
  Archaeological Society (NAS) along with MSDS Marine and CitiZan have been
  surveying the foreshore of Sandwich, Kent to record the many wrecks and other
  artefacts that are covered and uncovered with each tide. The surveys have been
  accurately positioned using Leica GPS Real Time Kinematic (RTK) equipment
  augmented with information from a fixed station, and the surveying of local
  areas was done using a Leica TS6 Total Station

The map showing the various sites found on the flats was produced for
the NAS Annual Conference 2019 using QGIS

The furthest point North is shown as 51.2975N 1.3792E

 The furthest point South is shown as 51.282199N 1.378861E

One degree Latitude (for our purposes) is 111.111 km. So from the top, to the bottom of the map is approximately 1700 metres

Depending on the tide the sea can be 450 metres from the cultivated or developed land

The numbering refers to the listings of the wreck sites produced by the NAS & MSDS Marine.
