excerpt: "Photo Mosaics - While mosaics are not a primary way of surveying a site, it is a great way to photograph a whole site or just one artifact, particularly in poor visibilty when a single photograph from a high position is not possible. A series of overlapping images are taken then merged together using relatively common software. It is important for each photograph to be taken from the same height and directly above the object. In training\_ this is aided with a simple framework as the inset photograph shows, the training was carried out on the remains of the Gresham Ship (Elizabethan wreck of 1574) at Stoney Cove Dive Centre just outside Leicester."
