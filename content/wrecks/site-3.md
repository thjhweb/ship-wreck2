excerpt: "Photo Mosaics - While mosaics are not a primary way of surveying a silte, it is a great way to photograph a whole site or just one artifact, particularly in poor visibilty when a single photograph is not possible. A series of overlapping images are taken then merged together using relatively common software. It is important for each photograph to be taken from the same height and directly above the object. In training\_ this is aided with a simple framework as the inset photograph shows, the training was carried out on the Gresham Ship remains at Stoney Cove Dive Centre just outside Leicester."
